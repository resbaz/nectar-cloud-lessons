# Prerequisites

These are the steps you need to have taken before arriving at the course. 

1. [ ] Make sure that you have an [AAF](http://aaf.edu.au/) login. Your institution should
       have more information on its web site. E.g. 
       [The University of Sydney's information page](http://staff.ask.sydney.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/667/~/what-is-the-australian-access-federation-%28aaf%29%3F)
1. [ ] Go the [NeCTAR dashboard page](https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/) and confirm that you can log in using your 
       AAF credentials. When you do this for the first time, you will activate a new 
       [trial project](https://support.rc.nectar.org.au/docs/allocations). If you have previous logged onto the 
       dashboard confirm that your trail project is still active, and if not either;<br />
   1. [ ] **request** an extension for this course. To request an extension, go to the [Allocations tab](https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/allocation/) of the dashboard and fill in a New Allocation request. Explain that you will be doing this course and give the date on which you will be doing the course.<br />
   1. [ ] **request** to be temporarily added to a specific allocation created for this training.<br />
1. [ ] You must bring a laptop with you that has a web browser and can support an ssh session.<br />
   1. [ ] Install the [x2go client](http://tinyurl.com/x2go-client) for your operating system.<br />
   1. [ ] If you are running MS windows, install [PuTTY and Xming](Windows.md) (the link gives instructions).<br />
   1. [ ] If you are running a Mac, install [X11](OSX.md) (the link gives instructions).<br />
1. [ ] If not running Linux, install the correct [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/) client that is correct for your laptop.
